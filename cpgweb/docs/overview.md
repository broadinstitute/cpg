# CPG Web Interface

The interface provides a user friendly way to navigate, explore and download
filtered `view` of the Cell Painting Gallery.

## Filtered views

The interface should provide features to filter the dataset based on the
following criteria:

- CPG prefix tokens
- Metadata files

## Navigate, explore and download

The interface should provide a file browser with support for limited viewing of
the supported data types. It should also provide an interface to generate code
snippets for downloading the filtered view of the dataset.
